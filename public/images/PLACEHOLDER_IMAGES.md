## Using Placeholder Services (Alternative)

If you want to test the layout first, you can use placeholder image services:

1. Go to https://placehold.co
2. Generate images with these URLs:
   - Hero slides: https://placehold.co/1920x1080/d4af37/white?text=Shubbies+Catering
   - Portfolio: https://placehold.co/800x600/d4af37/white?text=Portfolio+Image

However, **real photos will look much better** and are recommended even for testing!

## Tips for Choosing Images

✅ **DO:**
- Choose high-quality, professional-looking images
- Select images that match your brand style (elegant, classy)
- Use images with good lighting
- Pick images that show food, decor, or events similar to your services
- Ensure images are landscape orientation

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use low-resolution or blurry images
- Choose images with watermarks
- Select images that don't match your business style
- Use portrait-oriented images for hero slides

## When You Have Your Own Photos

Once you have professional photos of your actual work:
1. Get them professionally edited if possible
2. Optimize them for web (compress without losing quality)
3. Use tools like TinyPNG.com to reduce file size
4. Replace the placeholder images with your real photos
5. Keep the same file names for easy replacement
